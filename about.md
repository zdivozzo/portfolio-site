#About Zack
![Zack Divozzo]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/zack-photo.png)

I'm a front end developer living in Berkley, MI with my wife Kristina and daughter, Ruth. I've been making websites since I was fifteen, when I wanted to make video games but realized that it was too hard.  

After a few years doing home repair for low income families in West Virginia and Kansas City, we recently settled back in Michigan. Now I'm working for an awesome web development shop in West Bloomfield, High Level Marketing. I'm constantly learning and making things, <a href="&#109;a&#105;l&#116;&#111;:&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#114;&#121;&#100;&#105;&#118;&#111;&#122;&#122;&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">send me an email</a> to get in touch.
