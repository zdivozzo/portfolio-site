#About Zack
![Zack Divozzo]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/zack-photo.png)

I'm a front end developer living in Berkley, MI. I've been making websites since I was fifteen, when I wanted to make video games but realized that it was too hard.  

After a few years doing home repair for low income families in West Virginia and Kansas City, we settled back in Michigan. Now I'm working for Lake Trust Credit Union in Brighton, MI. I'm constantly learning and making things, <a href="&#109;a&#105;l&#116;&#111;:&#122;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#114;&#121;&#100;&#105;&#118;&#111;&#122;&#122;&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">send me an email</a> to get in touch.

###Tools I Like to Use

* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)
* Javascript (React, Angular and ES6+)
