# Comic Vine Quiz
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/comic-vine.jpg" class="showcase" />

A really difficult quiz app that I made with the [Comic Vine API](http://api.comicvine.com), which has over 99,000 character entries.  The 10 question quiz spits out a random character from the API and gives you five choices.

### Technologies used:
* React
* CSS 3 / SASS
* HTML 5
