#Find Your Farmers Market
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ffm.jpg" class="showcase" />

I built this site to interface with the USDA Farmers Market API to retrieve data based on an entered Zip code.  It returns a list of farmer's markets
that are close by, what they carry, and a link to Google Maps.

###Technologies used:
* Angular JS
* Vanilla Javascript
* CSS
* Foundation 5
