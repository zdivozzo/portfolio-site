#DeleteSite.js
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/deleteSite.png" class="showcase" />

<p>A small javascript file that can be included on any webpage to slowly delete the page, DOM node by DOM node.</p>

<p>Stick it on the console of any site and watch it slowly disappear. Better yet, slip it into a website undetected.</p>

<p>By default it deletes a node every second, but this can be adjusted.</p>

<p>Demo site coming soon</p>

###Technologies used:
* Vanilla Javascript
